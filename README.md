Making the photo editing workflow a breeze.

Not that I'm against Lightroom, but my biggest disappointment is with its sluggishness. It has improved, but my poor (maybe old) desktop churns using it, and doesn't utilize that powerful GPU I bought specially to do graphics.

[Bret Victor says](http://vimeo.com/36579366) that our tools should have an immediate connection with us, and I feel such delays drains the energy, creativity and drive from me.

Yes, this could be vapourware this point of time, but I'm using this to let go of my steam after I lost couple of hours work with my photo editing last night.

If I were to work on this, it'd be webgl and node.js based. If you really like to see this, then you should let me know [on twitter](https://twitter.com/BlurSpline).

Hope you had a good laugh, and have a nice day!
